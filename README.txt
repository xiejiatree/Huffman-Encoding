A functional and original Java implementation of the Huffman Algorithm, which compresses files using non-prefix-free encoding. The tree data structure utilizes binary to assign a bit value to each unique character within a file, compressing the file size by encoding large quantities of characters into relatively short bit Strings.

Compile and Run Instructions: HuffmanSubmit x is a new instance of the class HuffmanSubmit, which implements the Huffman interface, which contains the encode and decode methods.
